      <title>Zend Framework 2.0.4 Released!</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2012 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.0.4! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul><h2>Changes</h2>

<p>
    ZF2 has shipped with two "view strategies" aimed at simplifying common use 
    cases around developing JSON and XML APIs: <code>Zend\View\Strategy\JsonStrategy</code> 
    and <code>Zend\View\Strategy\FeedStrategy</code>. Each of these would
    select an appropriate renderer based on one of the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the view model present was of a specific type (e.g., 
        <code>JsonModel</code>, <code>FeedModel</code>).
    </li>
    <li>If the <code>Accept</code> header contained the appropriate media type.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This latter condition sparked some worry that, when enabled at the 
    application level (vs. enabled based on selected module, controller, action, or
    other more specific criteria), any endpoint could be forced to return JSON or Atom
    (based on the strategies registered), regardless of whether or not it was appropriate.
    This could lead to a couple bad situations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Data present in the view model not intended for actual display now being displayed.</li>
    <li>Raising of exceptions due to insuitability of certain view variables 
        for serialization in the selected format (e.g., invalid feed data, 
        non-JSON-serializeable objects, etc.); this could lead to resource 
        consumption and potentially other vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Based on these concerns, we made the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <code>JsonStrategy</code> and <code>FeedStrategy</code> now only ever select
        a renderer based on the current view model type: e.g. if you want to 
        expose something as JSON, you must return a <code>JsonModel</code>.
    </li>

    <li>Introduced a new controller plugin, <code>acceptableViewModelSelector()</code>.
        This helper can be used to select an appropriate view model if the <code>Accept</code>
        header meets criteria you specify.
    </li>
</ul>

As an example of the latter:

<pre class="highlight">
class SomeController extends AbstractActionController
{
    protected $acceptCriteria = array(
        'Zend\View\Model\JsonModel' => array(
            'application/json',
        ),
        'Zend\View\Model\FeedModel' => array(
            'application/rss+xml',
        ),
    );

    public function apiAction()
    {
        $viewModel = $this->acceptableViewModelSelector($this->acceptCriteria);
        
        // Potentially vary execution based on model returned
        if ($viewModel instanceof JsonModel) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The above would return a standard <code>Zend\View\Model\ViewModel</code> instance
    if the criteria is not met, and the specified view model types if the 
    specific criteria is met. Rules are matched in order, with the first match "winning."
</p>

<p>
    This release fixes an issue in the "Router" service that was affecting URL generation,
    among other things.
</p><p>
    Specifically, for the 2.0.1 release, a change was made to allow URL generation
    to continue to work even under a Console paradigm. However, this change apparently
    caused URL generation to break in a number of situations when in an HTTP paradigm.
    A fix was put into place, and integration tests created, to ensure this works
    going forward.
</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>
    A handful of other patches were also applied for this release;
    the full list of changes follows:
</p>

<pre>
- 2383: Changed unreserved char definition in Zend\Uri (ZF2-533) and added shell
  escaping to the test runner (https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2383)
- 2393: Trying to solve issue ZF2-558
  (https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2393)
- 2398: Segment route: add fix for optional groups within optional groups
  (https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2398)
- 2400: Use 'Router' in http env and 'HttpRouter' in cli
  (https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2400)
- 2401: Better precision for userland fmod algorithm
  (https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2401)
</pre>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>
    Many thanks to all contributors to this release, and particularly to Jurian Sluiman

<p>
    This release also includes a minor security fix; please read on for more details.
</p><h2>Security</h2>

<p>
    Robert Basic reported that a number of components had not been refactored 
    to use the new <code>Zend\Escaper</code> API internally. While they had been
    escaping output, the methodology did not always follow that of the Escaper
    component, and we decided to update them accordingly. You can <a href="/security/advisory/ZF2012-03">
    read more about the issue on the ZF2012-03 advisory</a>.

    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.0.0 <strong>STABLE</strong>! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>

</ul><p>
    Zend Framework 2 has been years in the making. Version 1.0.0 was released
    in July 2007 -- over 5 years ago! Since then, we've incrementally added 
    features, building on the solid base we'd created.
</p>

<p>
    A lot of code has been written on those foundations -- estimates of ZF
    downloads run anywhere from hundreds of thousands to millions, depending
    on the statistics you look at. It's been used to build everything from
    hobbyist websites to powering some of the most visited sites on the web.
    We've done a lot with Zend Framework 1 over the years.
</p>

<p>
    We also exposed a lot of cracks in the foundations. Patterns we'd taken 
    for granted, such as Singletons, reared their ugly heads and showed us
    where we'd built in inflexibility and hard-coded dependencies. We
    realized that while we'd built a number of interfaces, our code was
    making assumptions that fell outside those definitions. Some code, while
    it felt elegant, was difficult to learn, or improperly intermingled 
    different architectural concerns, creating problems where we hadn't had
    any before.
</p>

<p>
    Zend Framework 2 aims to build on our experiences with Zend Framework 1,
    to learn both from our mistakes as well as our successes.
</p>

<p>
    It's not perfect. No software project is. But I think it's qualitatively
    <em>better</em>. We finally achieved a dream that was conceived in the 0.X
    days of Zend Framework, to be able to create and consume standalone modules
    of MVC code. Thanks to the efforts of <a href="http://blog.evan.pro/">Evan
    Coury</a>, this was made possible via a new component, the <a href="/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.module-manager.intro.html">ModuleManager</a>,
    making the process trivially easy. Another problem that plagued ZF1 was how to get 
    dependencies into controllers -- the ZF1 solution of using a singleton
    (<code>Zend_Controller_Front</code>) to get at a registry (<code>Zend_Application_Bootstrap</code>) --
    was, quite simply, a testing nightmare. Today, via <a href="/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.service-manager.intro.html">the ServiceManager</a>,
    or, if you're gutsy, <a href="/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.di.introduction.html">Zend\Di</a>,
    we have standard, testable solutions; we have <a href="http://ralphschindler.com/">Ralph Schindler</a>
    to thank for both. Altering the workflow of the application or a single 
    component was often difficult -- the various hooks were either not 
    plentiful enough or difficult to arrange in different configurations. 
    Thanks to the <a href="/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.event-manager.event-manager.html">EventManager</a>,
    these use cases are easily resolved.
</p>

<p>
    The end result is that writing applications is a lot more flexible, and
    in many cases easier.
</p>

<p>
    If you've worked significantly with ZF1, ZF2 will look alien to you. That's
    okay. We'll continue to support ZF1 with bugfixes and security updates for the
    next 18 to 24 months. But start learning ZF2 -- I think once you do, you'll
    be amazed and impressed by what you can accomplish. We plan to publish a migration
    guide in the coming weeks to make your transition simpler, and to encourage
    you to start utilizing the power of ZF2 sooner.
</p>

<p>
    I'd go into detail on all the new components, but I don't want to bore you.
    You can <a href="/changelog/2.0.0">read the changelog</a>, or attend one of the
    <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/company/events/">many upcoming ZF2 webinars</a>
    at zend.com. I'll be <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/company/news/event/1112_webinar-getting-started-with-zf2">hosting 
    a ZF2 Intro next Wednesday</a> if you want some guidance.
</p>

<p>
    If you're feeling brave and want to try out ZF2 today, we offer the following
    resources:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/downloads/latest">Our downloads page</a> details how to get your hands on the source code.</li>
    <li><a href="/downloads/skeleton-app">Our skeleton application</a> is a fast way to have a working application that you can start tweaking.</li>
    <li><a href="/downloads/phpcloud">Or try out ZF2 on phpcloud</a>, which will get you up and running without needing to even start a web server!</li>
</ul>

<p>
    ZF2 has been the project of many people over the last couple years. I'd especially
    like to call out my team, and the community review team (CR Team) for their efforts:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ralph Schindler (Zend)</li>
    <li>Enrico Zimuel (Zend)</li>
    <li>Rob Allen (CR Team)</li>
    <li>Pádraic Brady (CR Team)</li>
    <li>Evan Coury (CR Team)</li>
    <li>Maks3w (CR Team)</li>
    <li>Ryan Mauger (CR Team)</li>
    <li>Dolf Schimmel (CR Team)</li>
    <li>Ben Scholzen (CR Team)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Take a moment to thank them when you get a chance -- without their efforts,
    there would not be a ZF2.
</p>

<p>
    Now, let's go build amazing things!

The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
of Zend Framework 2.0.0rc6! Packages and installation instructions are
available at:

</ul><p>
We've been releasing release candidates weekly since mid-July. 
At this time, RC6 is slated to be the last release candidate before shipping a 
stable version. 
</p>

<p>
RC6 has continued the cycle of decreasing numbers of pull requests, lending 
weight to the idea that we are hitting a stable API. Around 30 patches
were handled -- though not all were merged -- ranging from small consistency 
fixes to solutions for often-reported issues. Additionally, around 20 
documentation patches were handled, providing a steady stream of updates
for the user guide.
</p>

<p>
The full changelog is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
- Zend\Config
  - The INI adapter now allows bracket notation for appending values to an array
    within INI definitions.
- Zend\Db
  - ResultInterface adds isBuffered() method for checking if the resultset is
    buffered or not. Allows for more fine grained control of result set
    buffering, including using the database engine's native buffering.
  - Insertions with multi-part keys now work properly.
  - Expression objects may now be passed to the order() method of a Select
    object.
- Zend\Form
  - You can now omit error messages on elements when rendering via formRow(), by
    passing a boolean false as the third argument of the helper.
  - You can now use concrete hydrator instances with the factory.
  - You may now set the CSRF validator class and/or options to use on the Csrf
    element
  - The Select, Radio, and MultiCheckbox elements and view helpers were
    refactored to move value options into properties, instead of attributes.
    This makes them more consistent with other elements, and simplifies the
    interfaces.
  - Forms now lazy-load an input filter if none has been specified; this should
    simplify usage for many, and remove the "no input filter attached"
    exception.
  - All form helpers for buttons (button, submit, reset) now allow translation.
  - The formRow() view helper now allows you to set the CSS class used to
    designate an input with errors.
- Zend\Http
  - Some browser/web server combingations set SERVER_NAME to the IPv6 address,
    and enclose it in brackets. The PhpEnvironment\Request object now correctly
    detects such situations.
  - The Socket client will only fallback to SSLv3 if the ssltransport
    configuration key is not set (instead of also allowing SSLv2).
- Zend\I18n\Translator
  - Loader\LoaderInterface was splitted into Loader\FileLoaderInterface and
    Loader\RemoteLoaderInterface. The latter one will be used in ZF 2.1 for
    a database loader.
  - Translator::addTranslationPattern() and the option "translation_patterns"
    were renamed to Translator::addTranslationFilePattern and
    "translation_file_patterns".
  - A new method Translator::addRemoteTranslations() was added.
- Zend\Mvc
  - Application no longer defines the "application" identifier for its composed
    EventManager instance. If you had listeners listening on that context,
    update them to use "Zend\Mvc\Application". See this thread for more details:

      http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Change-to-Zend-Mvc-Application-s-event-identifiers-tp4656517.html

  - The redirect plugin's toRoute() method signature is now synced with that of
    the url plugin's fromRoute() method.
  - The PRG plugin now allows passing no arguments; if you do so, the currently
    matched route will be used for the redirect.
- Zend\Paginator
  - Removes the factory() and related methods. This was done to be more
    consistent with other components, and also because the utility was not
    terribly useful; in most cases, developers needed to configure the adapter
    up-front anyways.
- Zend\Stdlib
  - ClassMethods Hydrator now supports boolean getters prefixed with "is".
- Zend\Validator
  - DB validators no longer mix positional and named parameters.
</pre>

<p>
    The <a href="http://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication">skeleton
    application</a> and a <a
    href="http://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonModule">skeleton
    module</a> have been updated for 2.0.0rc6, and are a 
    great place to look to help get you started. You may also want to check out the <a
    href="http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/user-guide/overview.html">user guide
    </a>, as it provides a comprehensive tutorial for building a ZF2 application.
</p>

<p>
    As a reminder, all ZF2 components are also available individually as <a 
    href="http://pear2.php.net">Pyrus</a> AND <a 
    href="http://getcomposer.org">composer</a> packages; <a 
    href="http://packages.zendframework.com">packages.zendframework.com</a> 
    is our official channel for both package formats.
</p>

<p>
    I'd like to thank each and every person who has contributed ideas, feedback, 
    pull requests (no pull request is too small!), testing, and more -- we're
    almost to the goal of a stable next-generation framework!

of Zend Framework 2.0.0beta5. Packages and installation instructions are
available at:

<p>
This is the fifth and last in a series of planned beta releases. The beta 
release cycle has followed the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features 
have been added in each new release, and backwards compatibility (BC) has not 
been guaranteed. The desire has been for developers to adopt and work with new 
components as they are shipped, and provide feedback so we can polish the 
distribution.
</p>

<p>
Our plan at this time is to do some cleanup of the repository, fix some 
outstanding issues and features, migrate documentation to a new repository and 
format, and then begin the release candidate process. At this time, we 
anticipate few if any BC breaks between now and the first release candidate (RC).
Applications built today on beta5 will operate in the way we expect them to for 
the stable release.
</p>

<p>
Beta5 had a rigorous and busy schedule. We tackled a number of consistency
issues, and solidified the security the framework offers via several fixes and 
the new Escaper component. We processed over 400 pull requests again, in a 
shorter timeframe than we had for beta4; the community really pulled together
to get this release out the door.
</p>

<p>
    There are three primary new features for the release:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li><code>Zend\Escaper</code>, which provides an OWASP-compliant solution 
        for context-specific escaping mechanisms targetting HTML, HTML attributes, 
        URLs, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
    <li><code>Zend\I18n</code>, which leverages <acronym title="PHP Hypertext 
        Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>'s <code>ext/intl</code> extension to 
        provide localization, and also provides a new translation component.</li>
    <li><code>Zend\Form</code> now has new annotation support, allowing you
        to define annotations in your domain entities that can then be used
        to build a form and its related input filter and hydrator. Annotation
        support now has a dependency on <a 
        href="http://doctrine-project.org">Doctrine\Common</a>'s annotation 
        library, for our default annotation syntax parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    2.0.0beta5 had many more changes, as you can see from the release changelog:
</p>

<pre>
 - Escaper component (Padraic Brady)
    - Provides context-specific escaping mechanisms for HTML content,
      HTML attributes, URLs, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - BC BREAK: The escape() view helper was removed, and replaced with
      escapeHtml(), escapeHtmlAttr(), escapeJs(), escapeCss(), and
      escapeUrl() implementations.
 - New I18n component (Ben Scholzen, Chris Martin, Dennis Portnov,
   Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - New component leveraging PHP's ext/intl extension to provide
      internationalization (i18n) and localization (L10n) features and
      capabilities to applications.
    - LEVERAGES:
        - DateTime, DateTimezone, IntlDateFormatter
        - Locale
        - NumberFormatter
    - BC BREAK: REMOVES the following components:
        - Zend\Currency
        - Zend\Date
        - Zend\Locale
        - Zend\Measure
        - Zend\Translator
        - All filters, validators, and view helpers that relied on the
          above.
    - PROVIDES:
        - Zend\I18n\Translator, including support for gettext and
          PHP-array-based translations (more are planned).
        - Zend\I18n\Filter, containing localized filtering capabilites
          for Alnum (alphanumeric), Alpha (alphabetic), and NumberFormat
          (numerical strings).
        - Zend\I18n\Validator, containing localized validation
          capabilities for Alnum (alphanumeric), Alpha (alphabetic),
          Iban (international bank account number standard), Int
          (integer), and PostCode (localized postal codes).
        - Zend\I18n\View, containing localized view helpers for
          CurrencyFormat, DateFormat, NumberFormat, Translate, and
          TranslatePlural.
 - Db layer additions (Ralph Schindler, Rob Allen, Guillaume Metayer,
   Sascha Howe, Chris Testroet, Evan Coury, Ben Youngblood)
    - Metadata support
    - Postgresql adapter/driver
    - New HydratingResultSet, allowing the ability to specify a custom
      hydrator (from Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator) for hydrating row objects.
    - Many bugfixes and stabilizations
 - Form additions (Matthew Weier O'Phinney, Michaël Gallego, Yanick Rochon)
    - Annotations support: Ability to use annotations with a domain
      object in order to define a form, fieldsets, elements, inputs and
      input filters, and more.
    - Hydration of fieldsets; fieldsets may compose their own hydrators
      if desired.
    - Collection support; allows multiple instances of the same
      fieldset. As an example, you might have an interface that
      allows adding a set of form elements via an XHR call; on the
      backend, these would be defined as a collection, allowing
      arbitrary numbers of these fieldsets to be submitted.
    - New view helpers covering most HTML5-specific element types, most
      XHTML-specific element types. Additionally, a number of the
      HTML5-specific element types now have Element implementations to
      create turn-key solutions that include validation and filtering.
    - BC BREAK: Options support. Many attributes were being used not as
      HTML attributes but to define behavior. The ElementInterface now
      has an accessor and mutator for options. Examples of options
      include labels for non-radio/checkbox/select elements, the CAPTCHA
      adapter for CAPTCHA elements, CSRF tokens, etc. If you were
      defining labels in your forms, please move the label and label
      attributes definitions from the "attributes" to the "options" of
      the element, fieldset, or form.
    - BC BREAK: new interface, ElementPrepareAwareInterface, defining
      the method "prepareElement(Form $form)". The FieldsetInterface,
      and, by extension, FormInterface, extend this new interface. It is
      used to allow preparing elements prior to creating a
      representation.
 - MVC additions (Kyle Spraggs, Evan Coury, Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - New "Params" controller plugin. Allows retrieving query, post,
      cookie, header, and route parameters. Usage is
      $this->params()->fromQuery($name, $default).
    - New listener, Zend\Mvc\ModuleRouteListener. When enabled, if a
      route match contains a "\__NAMESPACE__" key, that namespace value
      will be prepended to the value of the "controller" key. This
      should typically be used in the root route for a given module, to
      ensure controller names do not clash.
    - Bootstrap simplification. A new "init()" method was created that
      accepts the path to a configuration file, and then creates and
      bootstraps the application; this eliminates all common boilerplate
      for the bootstrap scripts.
 - Hydrator changes (Adam Lundrigan)
    - BC BREAK: the ClassMethods hydrator now assumes by default that
      it should convert between underscore_separated names and
      camelCase.
 - BC BREAK: Doctrine Annotations Parser (Matthew Weier O'Phinney, Marco
   Pivetta, Guilherme Blanco)
    - Zend\Code\Annotation now has a dependency on Doctrine\Common for
      its annotation parser.
    - Annotations now conform to Doctrine's standards by default, but
      the AnnotationManager in ZF2 allows attaching alternate parsers
      for specific annotation types.
 - BC BREAK: Removal of Plugin Broker usage (Matthew Weier O'Phinney,
   Evan Coury)
    - All uses of the Plugin Broker / Plugin Class Locator combination
      were removed. A new class, Zend\ServiceManager\AbstractPluginManager, 
      was created and used to replace all previous usages of the plugin
      broker. This provides more flexibility in creation of plugins, as
      well as reduces the number of APIs developers need to learn.
    - Configuration of plugin managers is now done at the top-level. All
      plugin manager configuration follows the format utilized by
      Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceConfiguration, and
      Zend\ModuleManager\Listener\ServiceListener has been updated to
      allow informing it of plugin manager instances it should manage,
      as well as the configuration key to utilize.
 - BC BREAK: Coding Standards (Maks3w, Sascha Prolic, Rob Allen)
    - Renamed most abstract classes to prefix them with the term
      "Abstract". In particular, ActionController and RestfulController
      are now AbstractActionController and AbstractRestfulController.
    - Renamed getters in HTTP, EventManager, and Mail components. These
      components were using accessors such as "events()", "query()",
      "headers()", etc. All such accessors were renamed to prepend
      "get", and, in the case of "events()", renamed to indicate the
      actual object retrieved ("getEventManager()"). 
 - SECURITY FIX: XmlRpc (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - A security issue arising from XML eXternal Entity (XXE) injection
      was patched; see http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2012-01

The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
of Zend Framework 2.0.0beta4. Packages and installation instructions are
available at:

</ul><p>
This is the fourth in a series of planned beta releases. The beta release
cycle is following the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features will
be added in each new release, and BC will not be guaranteed; beta
releases will happen <em>approximately</em> every six weeks. The desire is for
developers to adopt and work with new components as they are shipped, and
provide feedback so we can polish the distribution.
</p>

<p>
Our plan at this time is to have one last beta towards the end of June 2012, 
and then begin the release candidate process. At this time, the MVC is looking
and operating in the way we expect it to for the stable release.
</p>

<p>
Beta4 was tremendously busy; as I compiled the release notes and looked through
the pull requests, I discovered we'd handled more than double the number of 
pull requests, and did similarly in terms of delivering new features and rewrites.
The community did a tremendous amount of work polishing the framework and making
it better.
</p>

<p>

    - Various fixes based on issue reports
 - Dojo
    - REMOVED. Support was for out-dated versions of Dojo, and with the new Form

      2.0.0 at this time.
 - EventManager (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - New SharedEventManager, a non-static version of the original
      StaticEventManager
    - StaticEventManager now extends SharedEventManager and implements a
      singleton pattern

      injects it in a non-shared EventManager instance per service; static usage
      is discouraged at this time.
    - attachAggregate() now accepts an optional $priority, which, when present,

      optionally a Hydrator and bound object.
    - New form view helpers accept the Form objects in order to generate markup.
    - Object binding allows direct binding of model data to and from the Form.
 - InputFilter (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - New component for object-oriented creation of input filters
    - Input objects compose filter and validator chains, as well as metadata
      such as required, allow empty, break on failure, and more.
    - InputFilter objects compose Input and InputFilter objects, and allow
      validating the entire set or specified validation groups.
 - Log (Enrico Zimuel, Benoit Durand)
    - Refactored to provide more flexibility
    - Adds API discoverability (instead of method overloading)
    - Uses the PluginBroker for loading writers and formatters

    - Renamed from "Module" to "ModuleManager"
    - Renamed "Consumer" subnamespace to "Feature"
    - Added new listeners:
      - OnBootstrapListener (Module classes defining onBootstrap() will have
        that method attached as a listener on the Application bootstrap event)
      - LocatorRegistrationListener (Module classes implementing the
        LocatorRegisteredInterface feature will be injected in the
        ServiceManager)
      - ServiceListener (Module classes defining getServiceConfiguration() will
        have that method called, and the configuration merged; once all modules
        are loaded, that merged configuration will be passed to the
        ServiceManager)
 - MVC (Matthew Weier O'Phinney, Ralph Schindler, Evan Coury)
    - Removed Bootstrap class and rewrote Application class
      - Composes a ServiceManager, and simply fires events
    - Added RouteListener and DispatchListener classes, implementing the default
      route and dispatch strategies.
    - Created a new "Service" subnamespace, with ServiceManager configuration
      and factories for the default MVC services.
    - Created a new "ViewManager" class, which triggers on the bootstrap event,
      at which time it creates the various objects of the view layer and wires
      them together as well as registers them with the appropriate events.
    - InjectTemplateListener now uses the controller namespace to further
      namespace the view template; the default is now 
      "<normalized top-level namespace>/<normalized controller name>/<action>"
 - ServiceManager component (Ralph Schindler, Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - Highly performant, programmatic service creation
    - Largely replaces DI, but can also consume Zend\Di
    - Allows:
      - Service registration
      - Lazy-loaded service objects
      - Service factories
      - Service aliasing
      - Abstract (fallback) factories
      - Initializers (manipulate instances after creation)
    - Fully integrated in the MVC solution
 - Renamed interfaces (Gabriel Baker, Sascha Prolic, Maks3w)
   - Most, if not all, interfaces were renamed to suffix with the word
     "Interface". This is to promote discovery of interfaces, as well as make
     naming simpler.
   - Exceptions are affected by this as well. Exception marker interfaces were
     renamed to ExceptionInterface and pushed into the Exception subnamespace of
     each component
 - Composer support (Rob Allen, Marco Pivetta, Kyle Spraggs)
   - Zend Framework is now installable via Composer (http://packagist.org/), as
     are each of its individual components
 - Travis CI integration (Marco Pivetta, Maks3w)
   - ZF2 is tested on each commit by http://travis-ci.org/
</pre>

<p>
    In all, well over <strong>400</strong>(!) bug and feature requests were 
    handled since 2.0.0beta2 -- about twice what was handled for beta3, which
    was in turn twice what we handled for beta2! We've definitely hit some
    critical momentum and adoption.
</p>

<p>
    Two changes are particularly noteworthy, as they are not so much code changes
    as infrastructure changes: ZF2 now has <a 
    href="http://packagist.org">Composer</a> support on a per-component basis, and 
    the project now has continuous integration via <a 
    href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>. A number of contributors helped
    make these initiatives not only possible, but succesful.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="http://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication">skeleton
    application</a> and a <a
    href="http://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonModule">skeleton
    module</a> have been updated for 2.0.0beta4, and are a 
    great place to look to help get you started. You may also want to check out the <a
    href="http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/zend.mvc.quick-start.html">quick start
    guide to the MVC</a>.
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, all ZF2 components are also available individually as <a href="http://pear2.php.net">Pyrus</a> 
 AND composer packages; packages.zendframework.com is our official channel.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to thank each and every person who has contributed ideas, feedback, 
pull requests (no pull request is too small!), testing, and more -- I'm constantly
amazed at the amount of energy and support the community contributes to the framework!

      <title>Zend Framework 2.0.0beta3 Released!</title>

<p>
This is the third in a series of planned beta releases. The beta release
cycle is following the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features will
be added in each new release, and BC will not be guaranteed; beta
releases will happen <em>approximately</em> every six weeks. The desire is for
developers to adopt and work with new components as they are shipped, and
provide feedback so we can polish the distribution.
</p>

<p>
Once all code in the proposed <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43745438">standard distribution</a> 
has reached maturity and reasonable stability, we will freeze the API and
prepare for Release Candidate status. 
</p>


<p>
Featured components and functionality of 2.0.0beta3 include:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li><b>Refactored Config component</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>All configuration readers have been moved under the <code>Zend\Config\Reader</code> namespace</li>
        <li>A <code>Zend\Config\Factory</code> has been added to simplify retrieving a config object from a config file</li>
        <li>Supported configuration formats now support importing additional configuration files</li>
        <li>All constant processing has been moved to a <code>Zend\Config\Processor</code> namespace, and expanded to be more powerful</li>
        <li>Work was provided by Ben Scholzen, Artur Bodera, Enrico Zimuel, and Evan Coury</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>New View layer</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>New subcomponents include <code>Zend\View\Model</code>, <code>Zend\View\Resolver</code>, <code>Zend\View\Renderer</code>, and <code>Zend\View\Strategy</code></li>
        <li>The old <code>Zend_View</code> class has been moved to <code>Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer</code>, and rewritten to move most of its responsibilities into collaborators, greatly simplifying its design while simultaneously giving it more capabilities.</li>
        <li>A new class, <code>Zend\View\View</code>, allows selecting rendering strategies on a per-template basis, based on arbitrary criteria, and optionally injecting rendering results into a Response object</code>
        <li>MVC integration streamlines common use cases, including View Model creation and injection, 404 and error page creation, and more.</li>
        <li>Work was provided by Matthew Weier O'Phinney, with copious feedback from Rob Allen.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rewritten DB layer</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>New architecture features low-level drivers, which also provide access to
    the PHP resource being consumed; adapters, which provide basic abstraction
    for common CRUD operations; new SQL abstraction layer, with full predicate
    support; abstraction for ResultSet's, with the ability to cast rows to
    specific object types; abstraction for SQL metadata; and a revised Table and
    Row Data Gateway.</li>
        <li>Work was provided by Ralph Schindler</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>New AgileZen component</b>

      <li>Work was provided by Enrico Zimuel</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>PHP 5.4 Support</b>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>A number of issues when running ZF2 under PHP 5.4 were identified and corrected.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    A number of other components received a fair amount of attention during 
    this beta cycle, including Zend\GData, Zend\Navigation, Zend\Session, 
    Zend\Service\StrikeIron, Zend\Service\Technorati, Zend\Service\Twitter, 
    Zend\Http\Header\Accept*, Zend\Ldap, Zend\OAuth. A fair amount of feedback 
    on the MVC and Module components was also provided and acted upon.
</p>

    In all, around 200 bug and feature requests were handled since 2.0.0beta2 --
    about twice what was handled for beta2!
